# thedac-rabbitmq-operator

## Description

Charmed [RabbitMQ][rabbitmq-upstream] operator for Kubernetes.

RabbitMQ is an open source multi-protocol messaging broker. The charmed
RabbitMQ operator deploys RabbitMQ as a workload on Kubernetes. It grants
access to the RabbitMQ management web interface. Having the operator charmed
allows for consuming charmed applications to simply add a relation in order to
begin using the message broker immediately.
