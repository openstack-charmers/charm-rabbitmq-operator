# rabbitmq-operator TODO

## TODOS

* Get integrator to allow multiple ports: 5672 and 15672
  * or maybe support multiple relations - one for AMQP and one for HTTP/API
* Enable rabbitmqctl commands once pebble grows one off command capability
* deal with rmq restarts when configuration files changes
* figure out exposure of RMQ external to K8S
